generating neighbours
	
	system 01: 	generate tile map without IDs first
				iterate over all tiles
				called tile bestows its ID on surrounding tiles
				needs:	pre-prepared grid to answer geographic queries
						"How many neighbors do I have?"
						"Where are my neighboring tiles located in relation to myself?"
						"How do I communicate my ID to those neighbors?"
	
	system 02:	generate neighbor relations on creation of tiles
				discern direction of creation beforehand
				iterate over ID and create tiles completely				
				needs:	harsh mathematics to pre-discern IDs and geographic relations
						pre-knowledge of board structure
						more mathematics to allow for different board structures
						IDs to exist before actual tile is created
						
	system 03:	generate entire tile map with IDs first
				iterate again over all IDs and fill the neighbours array of each tile
				discern direction of creation beforehand
				called tile grabs neighbouring IDs (!!!)
				needs:	okay mathematics to discern placement of tiles according to board structure
						(row 1, skip no steps up to x, row 2, skip steps 3-4-5 and 8-9 up to x etc.)
						clear data structure to enable tiles to "grab" IDs of neighbours
						(graph structure, any node has exactly six edges)
