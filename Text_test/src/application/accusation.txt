"You share the same affliction as our god! It's YOUR fault he is dying!
Go and find a cure for what you've done and MAYBE you can safe yourself as well!
You are hereby BANISHED on pain of death!
Return with the cure, or NOT AT ALL!
LEAVE US, FILTH!"

And so he went and left.

And he went far.

Not as far as you might think, though.
